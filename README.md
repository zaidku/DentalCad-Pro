## üéÆ Demo Mode

The application includes a comprehensive demo system:

- **Stage-by-Stage Demo**: Click individual stage buttons to jump to specific workflow stages
- **Auto Demo**: Run a complete automated demonstration of all workflow stages
- **Reset Function**: Return to the beginning of the workflow at any time

Access the demo panel from the top-right corner of the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **Font Awesome** for icons

### Key Components
- `DentalWorkflowManager` - Main workflow orchestration
- `DentalWorkflowDemo` - Interactive demonstration system
- React components for UI panels and controls
- 3D viewport with STL loading and manipulation

### File Structure
```

```

## üé® Customization

### Colors
The application uses a professional dental color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`:
- Primary: `#1e90ff` (DodgerBlue)
- Secondary: `#4169e1` (RoyalBlue)
- Accent: `#00bfff` (DeepSkyBlue)

### Workflow Stages
Modify the workflow stages in `dentalWorkflow.js`:
```javascript
this.stages = {
    1: {
        name: 'Order Form',
        title: 'Patient & Order Information',
        description: 'Enter patient details and restoration requirements',
        // ... additional configuration
    }
    // ... more stages
}
```

## üìã Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
